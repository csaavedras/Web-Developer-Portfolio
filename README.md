 Welcome to the Publication Management Platform, a comprehensive solution addressing the challenges of subscription management for magazine publications. The platform caters to three distinct user levels:

1. End-Users: Representing companies, end-users can effortlessly create, manage, and monitor their publications. They have access to a user-friendly dashboard, enabling them to publish, save, and track the status of their publications.

2. Editors: With access to submissions, editors can review and publish content. They possess the authority to manage posts, monitor statuses, and update the final publication status.

3. Administrators: Administrators wield full control, creating representative users for companies, enabling editors, and overseeing the entire platform. They can create users of all levels, including representatives, editors, and new administrators.
